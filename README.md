# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-SSD-Style-CNN-in-TensorFlow
This TensorFlow code builds a simple SSD-style CNN for CIFAR-10 classification. It loads and normalizes the dataset, defines a MobileNet-like base with convolutional layers, adds a classification head, compiles and trains the model, then predicts a test image and visualizes the SSD-style output showing predicted vs actual class.
